    <h1>Project Background</h1>

    <p>
        EEBS is a product of Boston College’s graduate-level capstone class, “Digital Humanities as Public Scholarship,” created in the spring of 2023. The author, <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/author">Elspeth Currie</a>, had come across a list in The Great Historical, Geographical and Poetical Dictionary (1694) while researching <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/bibliophiles">Anne Wentworth Watson, Lady Rockingham</a> and became curious about what these lists could tell us about early modern England.
    </p>

    <h1>Books Involved</h1>

    <p>
        EEBS’s database is sourced from subscriber lists from twelve books published in England between 1617 and 1698, listed here with their short title. Some are avaible for free online, but digital facsimiles of each can be found on Early English Books Online, hosted by ProQuest.

    <h1>Process and Tools</h1>

    <p>
        These books were identified from searches through Proquest’s Early English Books Online, references in secondary scholarship, and entries in The Book Subscription Lists: A Revised Guide, put together by Peter John Wallis and the Book Subscriptions List Project. EEBO provided digital facsimiles and some transcriptions of the texts.
    </p>

    <p>
        After identification, Elspeth used Google Documents OCR function to make initial transcriptions of any texts lacking one. She edited these and the existing transcriptions from EEBO before using Microsoft Excel to create the database. Tableau provided the tools to make data visualizations.
