<p>
    EEBS provides the demographic data of subscribers as recorded in the lists themselves, not sourced from outside research. As such, it may be “incorrect” when compared to other sources, failing to record someone’s correct title or occupation, for example. Here it is helpful to remember that subscriber entries reflect self-presentation: in this moment of time, how did this subscriber and the book undertaker choose to identify themself to the reading public?

<p>
    This sheet may be updated as other subscriber lists are added.
